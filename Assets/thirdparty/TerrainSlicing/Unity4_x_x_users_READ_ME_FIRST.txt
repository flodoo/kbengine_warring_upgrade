4.x.x Users
To add some functionality, please perform the following two steps (unless you've already performed them).

1) Delete the SliceTerrain.js file found in the editor folder. 
This file is for 3.x users and does not contain some functionality available to 4.x users.

2) Open the SliceTerrain.txt file and resave it as SliceTerrain.js (so Unity recognizes it as a JavaScript file). 
This file contains code for copying terrain materials and terrain texture normal maps.
