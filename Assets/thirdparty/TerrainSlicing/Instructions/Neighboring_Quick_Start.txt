Thank you for purchasing the Terrain Slicing & Neighboring Kit

4.x.x Users
To add some functionality, please perform the following two steps (unless you've already performed them).

1) Delete the SliceTerrain.js file found in the editor folder. 
This file is for 3.x users and does not contain some functionality available to 4.x users.

2) Open the SliceTerrain.txt file and resave it as SliceTerrain.js (so Unity recognizes it as a JavaScript file). 
This file contains code for copying terrain materials and terrain texture normal maps.

Neighboring Instructions

1) 	Drag the SetNeighbors script onto the first terrain of your terrain group. This terrain
	should have the smallest x and z values of all the terrains in your group, and will appear at the
	bottom left of your group from a top down orthgraphic view (press y on the gizmo)
	

2)	The script should appear in the inspector if you have the terrain selected. For the "Terrains Wide" field
	enter the number of terrains that exist along a single row (x axis) in your group.
	For the "Terrains Tall" field, enter the number of terrains that exist along a single column (z axis).
	
3) 	Press the auto fill button to have the tool fill the terrain fields in for you.
	If this doesn't work, or you want to do this step manually, drag the terrains
	in order (starting with the current terrain) from left to right, bottom to top, onto the
	terrain fields. 
	
***All the edges of the terrains must line up perfectly. This means each terrain can only have one neighbor
***to a side, and all terrains along a single row must have the same height, while all terrains along a single
***column must have the same width. If you experiment, you will see that this does not mean ALL terrains
***must have the same width/height. Also, your terrain group can have different numbers of rows/columns (like 4 x 2).
	
4) Press "Play" to see how the terrain edges disappear. The terrains should look like a single terrain.

If you have any problems, questions, or concerns, please feel free to contact me at kgillen@deepspacelabs.net. Please read the
instructional guides first, however, as it is more in depth than this document.
