Thank you for purchasing the Terrain Slicing & Neighboring Kit

4.x.x Users
To add some functionality, please perform the following two steps (unless you've already performed them).

1) Delete the SliceTerrain.js file found in the editor folder. 
This file is for 3.x users and does not contain some functionality available to 4.x users.

2) Open the SliceTerrain.txt file and resave it as SliceTerrain.js (so Unity recognizes it as a JavaScript file). 
This file contains code for copying terrain materials and terrain texture normal maps.

Slicing Instructions
1) 	Create your terrain, and name/place it whatever/wherever you want.

2) 	Select the terrain menu item from the top of Unity, and then
	"Slice Terrain" (or "Slice Terrain Pre 4.0 for non 4.0 users) from
	the drop down menu that appears. 
	
3) 	If you had a terrain selected when you clicked the menu button,
	the terrain will appear in the "Terrain to Slice" field. If it's empty
	drag the terrain you want to slice into this field.
	
4)	Enter the base terrains detail resolution per patch in the next field

5) 	Select the slicing dimensions : a 2 x 2 grid will form 4 terrain pieces with
	2 rows and 2 columns. A 4 x 4 grid will form 16 terrai pieces, etc., etc.
	
6) 	Enter a different filepath if you wish to store your TerrainData in a different folder than the default folder.
	Leave this field alone if you're fine with storing the data in the default folder.
	If you change the folder, you can set this new filepath as the default filepath by clicking the
	"Save Current File Path as Default File Path" button. Now everytime you slice a terrain in the future,
	this new filepath will appear.
	
7)	Click the "Create Terrain" button. A loading bar should appear if there are no errors. If there are errors,
	follow the instructions (might have to look at console for some) to rectify the problem.
	
**Please note that if you try to slice a terrain with the same name as a terrain that
has already been sliced, the new terrain data will overwrite the old terrain data.
I have included a safety net so that you can't do this on accident in the form of an overwrite check box.
If you try to overwrite existing data and this checkbox is unchecked, an error message will appear telling
you that you have to check the box in order to proceed.

If you have any problems, questions, or concerns, please feel free to contact me at kgillen@deepspacelabs.net.
Please read the instructional guides first, however, as it is more in depth than this document.
